Subject: Prospective Master’s Student Fall 2025 - Need information on research opportunities

Hello Girish Panicker,

Hope you are doing well.

My name is YourName, and I have completed Bachelor’s in Discipine from Your uni, Pakistan in September 2026. I have read your article about your research project related to “Conservation Research and C-factor Technology for Soil Erosion Prevention” and I really liked your work. I am currently working in a similar area “Soil Conservation and Erosion Management” in my internship at Waqas Waqar Engineers & Contractors.

My project Titled “Understanding the Morphological Behaviour of River Chenab: A Case Study” was presented in International Conference and Published in international Journal at Konya Turkey was fully funded by Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC). I was also engaged in a project related to “Soil Health and Nutrient Management” during my internship at Baig Construction in 2023. Additionally, looking at the new developments in “soil conservation and climate change mitigation” I have developed a keen interest to study in this field. Hence I would like to learn about the research opportunities to study and work under your guidance. I am attaching my CV with this mail for your reference.

Looking forward to your reply. Thank you.

Sincerely,
YourName
